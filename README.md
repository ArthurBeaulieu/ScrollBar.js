# FrontBase

This template was built to serve as a template for a JavaScript es6 component. It offers the Js and scss bundling process (webpack), a test instrastructure (based on Jasmine and Karma), a documentation generator all set up (jsDoc) and a html demo page that loads the newly created component.

It works on both Windows and Unix based system ; on Windows, double click the `init.bat` file and on Unix systems, run the `init.sh` script to set up the component environement. This script will ask your GitHub username and some project information (project name, description, version and license) in order to properly wire the configuration files. When done, all you have to do is start coding, without having in mind to setup all bundling, test, doc and demo for it.
